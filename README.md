Investigate the No-Show Appointments Dataset

Introduction

As data engineers, we are required to investigate the Medical Appointment No Shows dataset. The dataset contains information about a set of doctor appointments.
The goal is to investigate why a patient does not show up for his/her appointment. The dataset contains 110527 entries and 14 columns. It shows basic information about a set of doctor appointments.
Our goal for this project is to investigate the dataset of appointment records. The data includes some attributes of patients and state if the patients showed up to appointments. Our analysis is focused on finding trends influencing patients to show or not show up to appointments.
Using descriptive statistics, we were able to answer the questions asked and train a machine learning model to answer the most important question: What factors are important for us to know to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
